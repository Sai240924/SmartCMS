# Smart Complaint Management System

## Project Description
The Smart Complaint Management System is a full-stack web application designed to efficiently manage and resolve customer complaints. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB for data storage. The frontend is developed using Angular 19, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.

This platform allows users to register, log in, submit complaints with detailed information, track the status of their complaints, and view their profile with complaint history. The system also supports role-based access control and aims to provide a centralized dashboard for monitoring and managing complaints.

## Steps to Implement

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd project/backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend server will run on the configured port (default is usually 3000).

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd project/frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server (this will run both frontend and backend concurrently):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```
   to access the application.
